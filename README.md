# Tenzies Game

A fun dice-rolling game built with React, where players roll dice until all dice show the same value. Players can hold dice at their current values, and only the unheld dice will roll with each turn. Once all dice match and are held, the game is won, and confetti appears!

## Features

- Roll 10 dice until all show the same number.
- Click to "hold" dice at their current value between rolls.
- Winning condition: All dice are the same value and held.
- Confetti effect upon winning the game.
- Option to start a new game once the current one is won.

## Technologies Used
